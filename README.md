### See below for guides on how to use [project-name] & integrate it into your project.

## Installation
```bash
npm i cloudflare-r2.js
------ or ---------------------
yarn add cloudflare-r2.js
```

## Setting up 
first of all, you would need to create a build process for our client to work.

### 1. Creating a client instance
```js
const { R2 } = require("cloudflare-r2");
  /**
   * Building the R2 client Instance with the credentials you got from the Cloudflare R2 dashboard
   */
const x = new R2()
  .setSecret("xxxxxxxxx") // Your Cloudflare-R2 Secret Key
  .setAccessKey("xxxxxxxxxx") // Your Cloudflare-R2 Access Key
  .setId("xxxxxxxxxx") // Your Cloudflare-R2 ID
  .build(); // Building the client in the end
```
**Build Options** - Should be used while building the client instance (You can use them in any order)
- `setRegion` - You can toogle between the regions of the Cloudflare R2 server. (Default: `auto`)
- `setSecret` - Your Cloudflare-R2 Secret Key
- `setAccessKey` - Your Cloudflare-R2 Access Key
- `setId` - Your Cloudflare-R2 ID
- `build` - Building the client in the end

**Extra Options** - Should not be used while building the client
- `getClient` - Returns the client instance
- `getLogs` - Returns the logs of the client instance so far (Useful for debugging)


### 2. Uploading an image
**Methods**
- We have two methods for uploading images to the Cloudflare R2 server
  - `upload` - Uploads the image to the Cloudflare R2 server (Accepts path to the image)
  - `uploadRaw` - Uploads the Base64 raw image data to the Cloudflare R2 server (Accepts Base64 raw image data)

**Method 1 - Uploading an image using (upload)**
```js
const { traffic } = require("cloudflare-r2");
  /**
   * Using upload method to upload the files to the Cloudflare R2 server
   */
const x = new traffic()
  .bucketName("xxxxx") // Your Cloudflare-R2 Bucket Name where you want to upload the image
  .upload(["test/test.png"]); // Your image path (Must use an array)
```

**Method 2 - Uploading an image using (uploadRaw)**
```js
const { traffic } = require("cloudflare-r2");
  /**
   * Using uploadRaw method to upload the files to the Cloudflare R2 server
   */
const x = new traffic()
  .bucketName("xxxxx") // Your Cloudflare-R2 Bucket Name where you want to upload the image
  .uploadRaw(["Base64Data"]); // Your Base64 raw image data (Must use an array)
```

**Upload Options** - Should be used while uploading the image (You can use both the methods together)

- `bucketName` - Your Cloudflare-R2 Bucket Name where you want to upload the image `⚠️ Required`
- `upload` - Uploads the image to the Cloudflare R2 server (Accepts path to the image)
- `uploadRaw` - Uploads the Base64 raw image data to the Cloudflare R2 server (Accepts Base64 raw image data)

**Extra Options** - Should not be used while uploading the image
- `getUploadedFiles` - Returns the uploaded files so far (Useful for debugging)
- `getbucketName` - Returns the bucket name being used by the Instance (Useful for debugging)

**Aceessing the response**
- You can access the response of the `upload` or `uploadRaw` methods by using the `then` method
- `⚠️ if you are using both the methods together then you can only access the response of the last method`
- `📢 Suggested to use anyone method at a time while acessing the response`
```js
const { traffic } = require("cloudflare-r2");
  /**
   * Using upload method to upload the files toth e Cloudflare R2 server
   */
const x = new traffic()
  .bucketName("xxxxx") // Your Cloudflare-R2 Bucket Name where you want to upload the image
  .upload(["test/test.png"]) // Your image path (Must use an array)
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  });
```
**Response**
```js
{
     state: "suceess" | "failed";
     data: string of<Uploded FileName>; 
}
```
